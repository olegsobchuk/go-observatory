### Choose Worker Design Pattern

This document describes Worker's steps for work.

## Status

What is the status, such as **proposed**, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

## Context

Worker instance gets all configs from store and applies them.

## In consideration

We consider next patterns:
- Creational Design Pattern:
  - singleton;
  - factory;
  - abstract factory.
- Behavioral Design Patterns:
  - mediator;
  - iterator.
- Structural Design Patterns:
  - bridge.

## Decision :star:

Now we have very simple application, so we don't need to think over something very complicated.

It will be just simple service with several functions to retrieve and store data.


## Positive Consequences

One file, simple service
