# Problem Requirements Document

Our Organisation. Voice and text messages, data transfers via internet and local network.

Currently we use only network IP system for communication (phones, data transfering etc). So that, we have to support users and maintain this complicated network and telecomunication system. So that it is mandatory point to have as much as it is possible information about network throughput and availability of different end-points (PC, Routers).

Now, due to lack of appropriate programs we use command line interface (terminal on OS Windows 10) and `ping xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -t` command

We need to understand when network goes down and device is unreachable.

Requirements:

1. Works on local PC.
2. Can follow/observe multiple devices by IP address or domain name
3. Collects information from devices.
4. Groups information.
5. Shows information in chart for time period.
6. Shows device's online/current status (available or not)
